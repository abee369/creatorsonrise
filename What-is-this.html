      <h3>Why keep track?</h3>
      <p>Sometimes I see some cool creators that are highlighted and forget to subscribe or remember something that they did and want to go back to check. This happened multiple times and didn't find any resources that kept track of all the creators that were featured. So I decided to start one.</p>
